# Mixed messages project

This project will provide a different message every time someone reloads the script.  This will be a simple project requiring only some basic knowledge.

Unlike what I was exepecting.  This project is designed to be used with Node.  I have decided to make it compatible on both Node and the web.

## Topic

My projects topic will be random 3 part jokes that often won't make sense.

## Viewing

You can either clone this repo and try it in node or just head [here](https://github.amias.dev/mixed-messages)
